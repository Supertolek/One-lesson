# One-lesson
One Lesson is an app to store and edit course sheets.  
[One Lesson WebSite](https://supertolek.github.io/One-lesson/)  
I will soon release a functionnal version of the One Lesson application.

## Why?
I first decided to create this application beacause of a video from the YouTuber [Aywen](https://youtube.com/@AywenVideos).  
He gave us the ability to remix and createe a whole new version of his own programms, and I chose [Remember](https://github.com/Aywen1/remember).  
[Remember](https://github.com/Aywen1/remember) was my choice because when i create a programm, I wannt it to be the most usefull for everyone, and this one could help some students looking for a free, open-source and distraction-free service for writing their lessons.

## How?
I might explain later, right now i don't have that much time.

## For who?
[One Lesson](https://supertolek.github.io) is for students who want a pretty simple, yet complete application for writing their notes or their lessons.
